Midi Note Pad.  This is my first project after a day looking through the docs and the excellent community posts on the TouchOsc Discord.

This is a very basic/beginner example of creating a grid of buttons and lables and sending midi information out based on the note pressed.
I also tried to make this quick and simple and did not "ungroup" the grid which was my first impluse, ha ha.

First create a group, double click on the group to get inside and create two grids.
